Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile. 

I am a Computer Science student at [ETH Zurich](https://inf.ethz.ch) and have been passionate of software development since I was in the middle school.
I started developing (very badly written) software using Visual Basic .Net, because at the time I had no experience in coding and I saw VB .Net as an easy-enough entry point for creating simple Windows GUI applications (what's known in the business as "Windows Form Applications").

I started thinking seriously of coding when I first learned Java and understood that GUIs are not in any way essential to understand the basics of programming; very often they over complicate the code for a beginner.

Then, I switched to web development and learned HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. With them, I completely revamped my high school IT course website. By the way, you can find the code [here](https://github.com/ncavallini/ocinfo_libe) (Sorry, that the code is not properly pushed - it's all on a zip file under the _Release_ section, but my school wanted it so).
